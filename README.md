# Project Euler - Haskell
Learning Haskell (first functional language) via Project Euler tasks. Avoiding AI except for occassional debugging.

Project Euler: https://projecteuler.net/profile/adamhulme-haskell.png

- Goal 1: 10 problems (easy)
- Goal 2: 25 problems (moderate) (from what I remember, haven't done proj euler since uni)
- Goal 3: 30 problems (hard, I think)
